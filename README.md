# Neural Networks from Scratch (with Iris Dataset)

This project demonstrates a basic feedforward neural network built from scratch using Python and NumPy. It uses the Iris dataset to classify flower species. All steps — from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation — are implemented without any deep learning libraries.

## 📂 File Included
- `neural_network_from_scratch_iris.ipynb`: Full code in Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Features
- Manual forward and backpropagation
- Softmax & Sigmoid activations
- Cross-entropy loss
- Accuracy evaluation on test set
- Uses the built-in `sklearn.datasets.load_iris` dataset

## 🧠 Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
